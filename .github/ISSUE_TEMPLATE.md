Thanks for using NullAway. Before you create an issue, please consider the following points:

  - [ ] If you think you found a bug, please include a code sample that reproduces the problem. A test case that reproduces the issue is preferred. A stack trace alone is ok but may not contain enough context for us to address the issue.

  - [ ] Please include the library version number, including the minor and patch version, in the issue text.
