## NullAway: Fast Annotation-Based Null Checking for Java [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/uber/NullAway.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/uber/NullAway)

NullAway is a tool to help eliminate `NullPointerException`s (NPEs) in your Java code.  To use NullAway, first add `@Nullable` annotations in your code wherever a field, method parameter, or return value may be `null`.  Given these annotations, NullAway performs a series of type-based, local checks to ensure that any pointer that gets dereferenced in your code cannot be `null`.  NullAway is similar to the type-based nullability checking in the Kotlin and Swift languages, and the [Checker Framework](https://checkerframework.org/) and [Eradicate](http://fbinfer.com/docs/eradicate.html) null checkers for Java.

NullAway is *fast*.  It is built as a plugin to Error Prone and can run on every single build of your code.  In our measurements, the build-time overhead of running NullAway is usually less than 10%.  NullAway is also *practical*: it does not prevent all possible NPEs in your code, but it catches most of the NPEs we have observed in production while imposing a reasonable annotation burden, giving a great "bang for your buck."  At Uber, we combine NullAway with [RAVE](https://github.com/uber-common/rave) to obtain thorough protection against NPEs in our Android apps.

## Installation

### Overview

NullAway requires that you build your code with [Error Prone](http://errorprone.info), version 2.1.1 or higher.  See the [Error Prone documentation](http://errorprone.info/docs/installation) for instructions on getting started with Error Prone and integration with your build system.  The instructions below assume you are using the Gradle build system; integration with other systems should require similar steps.

### Gradle
To integrate NullAway into your project add the following to your `build.gradle` file:

```gradle
buildscript {
  repositories {
    maven {
      url "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/"
    }
  }
}

plugins {
  id "net.ltgt.apt" version "0.11"
  id "net.ltgt.errorprone" version "0.0.11"
  id "java"
}

dependencies {
    apt "com.uber.nullaway:nullaway:0.1.0"

    compile "com.google.code.findbugs:jsr305:3.0.2"

    errorprone "com.google.errorprone:error_prone_core:2.1.1"
    errorprone "org.checkerframework:dataflow:2.2.0"

}

compileJava {
    options.compilerArgs += ["-Xep:NullAway:ERROR", "-XepOpt:NullAway:AnnotatedPackages=com.uber"]
}
```

Let's walk through this script step by step.  The `buildscript` section of the script adds the Maven repository for Gradle plugins.  The `plugins` section pulls in the [Gradle Error Prone plugin](https://github.com/tbroyer/gradle-errorprone-plugin) for Error Prone integration, and the [Gradle APT plugin](https://github.com/tbroyer/gradle-apt-plugin) to ease specification of annotation processor dependencies for a build.  We need the latter since Error Prone loads plugin checkers from the annotation processor path.  Note that the Gradle APT plugin is appropriate for Java projects; for Android projects, use an `annotationProcessor` dependence with the [Android Gradle plugin](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/gradle-plugin.html).

In `dependencies`, the `apt` line loads NullAway, and the `compile` line loads a [JSR 305](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=305) library which provides a suitable `@Nullable` annotation (`javax.annotation.Nullable`).  NullAway allows for any `@Nullable` annotation to be used, so, e.g., `@Nullable` from the Android support or IntelliJ annotations is also fine.  The two `errorprone` lines ensure that the minimum compatible versions of Error Prone and the Checker dataflow library are used.

Finally, in the `compileJava` section, we pass some configuration options to NullAway as compiler arguments.  The first argument `-Xep:NullAway:ERROR` is a standard Error Prone argument that sets NullAway issues to the error level; by default NullAway emits warnings.  The second argument, `-XepOpt:NullAway:AnnotatedPackages=com.uber`, tells NullAway that source code in packages under the `com.uber` namespace should be checked for null dereferences and proper usage of `@Nullable` annotations, and that class files in these packages should be assumed to have correct usage of `@Nullable` (see [the docs](https://github.com/uber/NullAway/wiki/Configuration) for more detail).  NullAway requires at least the `AnnotatedPackages` configuration argument to run, in order to distinguish between annotated and unannotated code.  See [the configuration docs](https://github.com/uber/NullAway/wiki/Configuration) for other useful configuration options.

We recommend addressing all the issues that Error Prone reports, particularly those reported as errors (rather than warnings).  But, if you'd like to try out NullAway without running other Error Prone checks, you can pass `"-XepDisableAllChecks"` to the compiler, before the NullAway-specific arguments.

## Code Example

Let's see how NullAway works on a simple code example:
```java
static void log(Object x) {
    System.out.println(x.toString());
}
static void foo() {
    log(null);
}
```
This code is buggy: when `foo()` is called, the subsequent call to `log()` will fail with an NPE.  You can see this error in the NullAway sample app by running:
```bash
cp sample/src/main/java/com/uber/mylib/MyClass.java.buggy sample/src/main/java/com/uber/mylib/MyClass.java
./gradlew build
```

By default, NullAway assumes every method parameter, return value, and field is _non-null_, i.e., it can never be assigned a `null` value.  In the above code, the `x` parameter of `log()` is assumed to be non-null.  So, NullAway reports the following error:
```
warning: [NullAway] passing @Nullable parameter 'null' where @NonNull is required
    log(null);
        ^
```
We can fix this error by allowing `null` to be passed to `log()`, with a `@Nullable` annotation:
```java
static void log(@Nullable Object x) {
    System.out.println(x.toString());
}
```
With this annotation, NullAway points out the possible null dereference:
```
warning: [NullAway] dereferenced expression x is @Nullable
    System.out.println(x.toString());
                        ^
```
We can fix this warning by adding a null check:
```java
static void log(@Nullable Object x) {
    if (x != null) {
        System.out.println(x.toString());
    }
}
```
With this change, all the NullAway warnings are fixed.
