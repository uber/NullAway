/**
 * This handler is used to serialize information regarding methods that initialize a class field.
 *
 * <p>It uses the following heuristic: if a method assigns a {@code @NonNull} value to a field, and
 * furthermore guarantees that said field is {@code @NonNull} on return from the method, then we
 * serialize information for this method as a potential initializer for that field. This information
 * can be used by an inference tool to detect initializer methods in classes.
 *
 * <p>Note that the above two conditions are both needed to eliminate the cases below:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Methods that initialize a field conditionally through only some of their execution paths
 *   <li>Methods which only check that the field is already initialized and terminate exceptionally
 *       otherwise (these methods guarantee the field is initialized on return, but are rarely what
 *       we are looking for when we look for candidates for {@code @Initializer})
 * </ul>
